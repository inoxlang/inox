# Inox

<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122291844?s=200&v=4" alt="a shield"></img>

Inox is a single-binary platform that will ultimately contain all you need to
develop, test, and deploy web apps. Applications are developped using
**Inoxlang**, a high-level programming language that deeply integrates with
several components:

- A built-in database that stores data structures (e.g. objects, lists, sets,
  maps, message threads)
- An HTTP server with filesystem routing
- A testing engine supporting virtual filesystems and temporary databases
  (completely transparent for application code).
- An in-process container engine: each application runs in a dedicated virtual
  filesystem, and is subject to permissions. _This is not related to Linux
  containers._

Here are a few example files that are part of a basic todo app with accounts and
persistence.

I have been working over 2 years on Inox. There is still work to do in
order to make Inox usable in real world applications. If you believe this
project has potential, **consider donating** through
[GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/GraphR00t) (preferred) or
[Patreon](https://patreon.com/GraphR00t). It will help me continue working on
Inox (check see 'What is planned' and [Other features](#other-features)).

**<summary>üóìÔ∏è What is planned ?</summary>**

- Finish the transaction system and support persisting most data-structure types
  with accepable performance.
- Automated database backups in S3-compatible storage.
- A user interface for viewing and modifying the schema and data of databases.
- Log persistence in S3 (note that Inox has builtins for
  [structured logging](#structured-logging).
- Support automated deployments on popular cloud providers
- Storage of secrets in key management services (e.g. GCP KMS, AWS KMS).
  [Secrets](./docs/language-reference/secrets.md) are special Inox values that
  cannot be printed, logged or serialized.
- Develop a standard library
- Integrate a subset of Git (using https://github.com/go-git/go-git and
  https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/scm-provider)
- Support no-downtime upgrades
- **WebAssembly support** using https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero
- Team access control for Inox projects
- Improve execution performance and memory usage
- Finalize the implementation of
  [structs](./docs/language-reference/transient-types.md#structs) and implement
  a [Low Level VM](https://github.com/inoxlang/inox/issues/32).
- Allow developers to define custom builtins written in Go (note: building inox
  is just `go build ./cmd/inox`)
- Analytics
- And more !

## Development Environment - Inox Project Server

**There is no true local development environment when developing Inox
projects.** The code editor connects to a **project server** (included in the
Inox binary) and the code is edited and tested inside a virtual workspace. The
server does not yet integrate git yet, but this is planned,
https://github.com/go-git/go-git.

Each developer in the project will ultimately have its own copy. As of now the
project server only supports projects with a single developer.

**Pros**

- All developers in the project will have an identical development environment.
- Code conflicts could be detected early, even before a developer commmits.
- Dependency downloads should be faster because they are made by the project
  server, which is expected to run on machine in a datacenter. Also downloaded
  dependencies can be shared between developers.
- The project does not need to be downloaded by the developer.

**Cons**

- An Internet connection is required. However code files are cached on the
  developer's machine for offline access (read only for now).

Project servers are expected to run on a dedicated machine. They will support
automatic infrastructure management in the near future.

<details>

**<summary>‚öôÔ∏è Details</summary>**

The project server is a LSP server with additional custom methods. It enables
the developer to develop, debug, test, deploy and manage secrets, all from
VSCode.

<summary>Scripting</summary>

Inox can be used for scripting & provides a shell. The development of the
language in those domains is not very active because Inox primarily focuses on
Web Application Development.

### Structured Logging

![structured logging demo](./docs/img/structured-logs.png)

[Documentation](./docs/builtins.md#structured-logging)

### Secrets

Secrets are special Inox values, they can only be created by:

- Defining an **environment variable** with a pattern like `%secret-string`
- Storing a [project secret](./docs/project.md#project-secrets)
- Built-in functions (e.g. a function returning a private key)

Secrets have special properties:

- The content of the secret is **hidden** when printed or logged.
- Secrets are not serializable, so they cannot be included in HTTP responses.
- A comparison involving a secret always returns **false**.

```
manifest {
    ...
    env: %{
        API_KEY: %secret-string
    }
    ...
}

API_KEY = env.initial.API_KEY
```

### Built-in Browser Automation

h = chrome.Handle!()

h.nav https://go.dev/
node = h.html_node!(".Hero-blurb")
h.close()
```

[Examples](https://github.com/inoxlang/inox/tree/main/examples/chrome)

> Browser automation is quite buggy right now, I need to improve the
> configuration of https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp.

### Composable String Patterns

Inox has composable string patterns that are more readable than regular
expressions (Inox still supports regexps though). Let's see an example, here is
the regexp for matching time (e.g. 01:45 AM).

```js
/^(?<hour>(1[0-2]|0?[1-9])):(?<minute>[0-5][0-9]) (?<period>AM|PM)$/

//Same regexp but without group names.
/^(1[0-2]|0?[1-9]):([0-5][0-9]) (AM|PM)$/
```

Inox string pattern:

![image](https://github.com/inoxlang/inox/assets/113632189/684b91f3-e7e1-42a1-86b1-60283ec3b038)

<!--
pattern time = str(
    hour: (
      | '1' '0'..'2'
      | '0'? '1'..'9'
    )
    ':'
    minute: ('0'..'5' '0'..'9')
    ' '
    period: (| "AM" | "PM")
)
-->

Composed Inox string pattern:

![image](https://github.com/inoxlang/inox/assets/113632189/fa78ec91-4794-45e1-bb17-1b0d4ea40af8)

<!--
pattern time-hour = str(
   | '1' '0'..'2'
   | '0'? '1'..'9'
)

pattern time-minute = str('0'..'5' '0'..'9')

pattern time-period = str(| "AM" | "PM")

pattern time = str(
    hour: time-hour
    ':'
    minute: time-minute
    ' '
    period: time-period
)
-->

Pattern equivalent to the regex `^a+b{8}c*$`.

![image](https://github.com/inoxlang/inox/assets/113632189/a0b71d3c-7cd6-4ba4-b794-eb9cd955cf33)

<details>

**<summary>Recursive string patterns (WIP)</summary>**

```
pattern json-list = @ str( 
    '[' 
        (| atomic-json-val
         | json-val 
         | ((json-val ',')* json-val) 
        )? 
    ']'
)

pattern json-val = @ str(| json-list | atomic-json-val)
pattern atomic-json-val = "1"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Recursive string patterns are not intended to be used for validating or
parsing large inputs.

</details>

### Context Data

The [context](docs/language-reference/context.md) of module instances can
contain data entries that can be set **only once**. Child modules have access to
the context data of their parent and can individually override entries.

```
add_ctx_data(/lang, "en-US")

...

fn print_error(){
  lang = ctx_data(/lang)
  ...
}
```

The HTTP server adds a `/session` entry to the handling context of a request if
the `session-id` cookie is present.

### Recursive Execution Cancellation

The [context](docs/language-reference/context.md) of each module instance can be
cancelled. If you are familliar with Golang: this is analogous to the
cancellation of a `context.Context`.

The cancellation of a context causes all operations to stop:

- Execution of the module.
- Pending I/O operations such as HTTP requests and filesystem operations are
  cancelled.
- Child modules are recursively cancelled as well. Lightweight threads are
  stopped.

### Lightweight threads

```
lthread = go {} do {
  print("hello from lightweight thread !")
  return 1
}

# 1
result = lthread.wait_result!()
```

### Lthread Groups

```
group = LThreadGroup()
lthread1 = go {group: group} do read!(https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1)
lthread2 = go {group: group} do read!(https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2)

results = group.wait_results!()
```

### More Secure Path Interpolations

In Inox interpolations are always restricted in order to prevent **injections**
and regular strings are **never trusted**. URLs & paths are first-class values
and must be used to perform network or filesystem operations.

```
filepath = ./go
/home/user/{filepath} # /home/user/go

filepath = ../../etc/shadow # malicious user input
/home/user/{filepath} 
# error: result of a path interpolation should not contain any of the following substrings: '..', '\', '*', '?'
```

> This is still work in progress, Allowing specific dangerous substrings may be
> supported in the future.

### More Secure URL Interpolations

URL interpolations are restricted based on their location (path, query).

```
https://example.com/{path}?a={param}
```

In short, most malicious `path` and `param` values provided by a malevolent user
will cause an error at run time.

<details>
<summary>
 Click for more explanations.
</summary>

Let's say that you are writing a piece of code that fetches **public** data from
a private/internal service and returns the result to a user. You are using the
query parameter `?admin=false` in the URL because only public data should be
returned.

```
public_data = http.read!(https://private-service{path}?admin=false)
```

The way in which the user interacts with your code is not important here, let's
assume that the user can send any value for `path`. Obviously this is a very bad
idea from a security standpoint. A malicious path could be used to:

- perform a directory traversal if the private service has a vulnerable endpoint
- inject a query parameter `?admin=true` to retrieve private data
- inject a port number

In Inox the URL interpolations are special, based on the location of the
interpolation specific checks are performed:

```
https://example.com/api/{path}/?x={x}
```

- interpolations before the `'?'` are **path** interpolations
  - the strings/characters `'..'`, `'\\'`, `'?'` and `'#'` are forbidden
  - the URL encoded versions of `'..'` and `'\\'` are forbidden
  - `':'` is forbidden at the start of the finalized path (after all
    interpolations have been evaluated)
- interpolations after the `'?'` are **query** interpolations
  - the characters `'&'` and `'#'` are forbidden

In the example if the path `/data?admin=true` is received the Inox runtime will
throw an error:

```
URL expression: result of a path interpolation should not contain any of the following substrings: "..", "\" , "*", "?"
```

</details>

---

### Isolation of Dependencies

Permissions granted to the imported modules are specified in the import
statements.

`./app.ix`

```
manifest {
  permissions: {
    read: %/...
    create: {threads: {}}
  }
}

import lib ./malicious-lib.ix {
  arguments: {}
  allow: {
    read: %/tmp/...
  }
}
```

<details>

**<summary>./malicious-lib.ix</summary>**

```
manifest {
  permissions: {
    read: %/...
  }
}

data = fs.read!(/etc/passwd)
```

</details>

If the imported module asks more permissions than granted an error is thrown:\
`import: some permissions in the imported module's manifest are not granted: [read path(s) /...]`

### Process-Level Access Control

In addition to the checks performed by the permission system, the **inox**
binary uses [Landlock](https://landlock.io/) to restrict file access for the
whole process and its children.

### Dropping Permissions

Sometimes programs have an **initialization** phase, for example a program reads
a file or performs an HTTP request to fetch its configuration. After this phase
it no longer needs some permissions so it can drop them.

```
drop-perms {
  read: %https://**
}
```

## Per-Module Limits

(WIP)

Limits limit intensive operations, there are three kinds of limits: **byte
rate**, **frequency** & **total**. They are defined in the manifest and are
[shared](./docs/language-reference/README.md#limits) with the children of the
module.

```
manifest {
    permissions: {
        ...
    }
    limits: {
        "fs/read": 10MB/s
        "http/req": 10x/s
    }
}
```

By default strict limits are applied on HTTP request handlers in order to
mitigate some types of DoS.

## Questions You May Have

### Why isn't Inox using a container runtime such as Docker ?

<details>

Because the long term goal of Inox is to be a **simple**, single-binary and
**super stable** platform for applications written in Inoxlang and using
libraries compiled to WASM.\
Each application or service will ultimately run in a separate process:

- filesystem isolation is achieved by using virtual filesystems (meta
  filesystem)
- process-level access control is achieved using
  [Landlock](https://landlock.io/). (This is still work in progress).
- fine-grained module-level access control is already achieved by Inox's
  permission system
- process-level resource allocation and limitation will be implemented using
  cgroups
- module-level resource allocation and limitation is performed by Inox's limit
  system

</details>

### Can native binaries be executed inside the virtual filesystem ?

<details>

No but executing WebAssembly modules and programs will be possible.

</details>

### Does Inox use a single process ?

<details>

- The inox daemon runs in a single dedicated process.
- As of now the project server and applications launched by developers run in the same process. This is obviously a **temporay solution**.

In the planned architecture every important component runs in a separate `inox` process.

```mermaid
graph TB

Inoxd(inoxd) --> |$ inox project-server -config='...'| ProjectServer("Project Server (may be on a dedicated machine)")
Inoxd --> |spawns| NodeAgent
NodeAgent("Node Agent \n [uses cgroups]") --> |creates process| DeployedApp1(Deployed Application 1)
NodeAgent --> |creates process| DeployedApp2(Deployed Application 2)
NodeAgent --> |creates process| ServiceModule(Separate Service of App 1)
ServiceModule -..- DeployedApp1

ProjectServer --> |asks to deploy/stop apps| NodeAgent
```

</details>


### Why have you created Inox ?

<details>

Before reading the answser please make sure to read the **Goals & Non Goals
sections**.

I like creating programming languages. At the beginning Inox was not even about
full stack development. It quickly evolved towards this use case because I am
tired of accidental complexity in full stack development. I particularly hate
having to glue and import components that are just needed 99% of the time. I
don't like spending hours configuring stuff, a bit of configuration is fine
though. Local development environments are also a pain to setup sometimes.
(There is no true
[local dev environment](#development-environment---inox-project-server) when
developing Inox projects).

Inox being an opinionated **high-level** programming language / high level
platform it obviously has pros and cons. Also when using a new programming
language you don't have access to a rich ecosystem. In other words Inox
currently does not bring all the potential value it could bring.

</details>

### Does Inoxlang support multi-threading ?

<details>

Inoxlang uses **goroutines** under the hood and allows the developer to create
[lighweight threads](#lightweight-threads). The HTTP server is built upon
Golang's HTTP server: each request is handled in a dedicated goroutine that runs
a bytecode interpreter.

</details>

### Is Inoxlang fast ?

<details>

Each Inoxlang module is executed by a bytecode interpreter. As of now this
interpreter is not optimized, yet. Also since it is intended to execute
businness logic it always checks for integer overflow/underflow in arithmetic
operation. Doing this has a cost.

I plan to optimize the interpreter and add an additional, lower-level,
[interpreter](https://github.com/inoxlang/inox/issues/32) that will execute
**low-level** mode code only. This includes struct methods and low-level
functions. In this mode only a few types are available (structs, int, float,
bool, string, ...). High-level data structures such as objects and lists are
primarly designed to represent **domain data** and to interact with the
database. They are not designed to be ultra fast.

I also need to improve the creation of interpreters for request handlers so that
it's fast and cheap in memory.

</details>

### Is Inoxlang sound ?

<details>

No, Inoxlang is **unsound**. However:

- The type system is not complex, and I do not plan to add many features
  impacting it. I will not add object methods nor classes.
- Type assertions using the `assert` keyword are checked at run time.
- The `any` type is not directly available to the developer, and it does not
  disable checks like in Typescript. It is more similar to **unknow**.

_\*Types like Set are kind of generic but it cannot be said that generics are
implemented._

_The type checking system not being implemented in a classic way, that will lead
to some limitations and a bit less safe checks. However the type checking logic
is not expected to grow much. Therefore the vast majority issues should be
resolved by testing extensively._

</details>

### What architectures and operating systems are supported ?

<details>

As of now, only Linux distributions on the `AMD64` architecture are supported.

- Support for Linux and MacOS on `ARM64` will likely be implemented.
- Windows support will not be implemented. If you use this OS you should be able
  to run Inox on WSL.

</details>

### What is the state of the codebase (quality, documentation, tests) ?

<details>

As of now, certain parts of the codebase are not optimally written, lack
sufficient comments and documentation, and do not have robust test coverage.
