# [Binary Expressions] 

manifest {}

# Operands of binary operations need to be parenthesized, unless they are 'simple':

 n = 1 + 2         # ok

 # n = 1 + 2 + 3   # error
 n = (1 + 2) + 3   # ok
 n = 1 + (2 + 3)   # ok

# Parentheses can be omitted around operands of or/and chains:

a = true; b = false; c = true

(a or b or c)      
(1 < 2 or 2 < 3)

# 'or' and 'and' cannot be mixed in the same chain
# (a or b and c)
