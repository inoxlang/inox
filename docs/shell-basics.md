# Inox Shell (REPL)

Launch the shell with the following subcommand:
```
inox
```

Note: the `inox shell` command can also be used.

Before starting the shell ``inox`` will execute the startup script `~/.config/inox/startup.ix` (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/inox/startup.ix) that set the [configuration](#configuration).

## Pseudo Commands (quit, clear)

- The `quit` pseudo command stops the process.
- The `clear` pseudo command clears the screen.

## Syntax

### Calling a Function

Copy the following code in the Inox shell & press Enter:
```
fn f(...args){ print $args } # this function prints its arguments
```

Functions in Inox can be called in several ways:
```
f() 
output: []

f;
output: []

f 1 2 3
output: [1, 2, 3]
```

The last call syntax is named a **command-like** call.

### Variables

When you reference a variable in the shell (or in an Inox script) you can directly use its name
or prefix it with a dollar.

```
a = 1; b = 2
(a == $b)
```

⚠️ In a **command-like** call `a` is considered as an identifier value that can also be written `#a`, 
you have to use `$a` to reference a.

```
f $a a
output: [1, #a]
```

### Pipe Statements

Pipe statements are analogous to pipes in Unix but they operate on the values returned by functions rather than on file descriptors.

Here is an example:

```
map_iterable [{value: "a"}, {value: 1}] .value | filter_iterable $ %int
```

- in the first call we extract the .value property of several objects using the `map_iterable` function
- in the second call we filter the result of the previous call
  - `$` is an anonymous variable that contains the result of the previous call
  - `%int` is a pattern matching integers


Pipe expressions enable you to save the final result into a variable:
```
ints = | map_iterable [{value: "a"}, {value: 1}] .value | filter_iterable $ %int
```

> You can add '~' in front of **$** if you want to perform the [type checking](#type-checker) at run time.

### Help

```
help <name of the function>

example:
help find
```

## Type Checker

The type checker performs various checks before the input code is executed, allowing you to quickly catch errors.

```
> map_iterable 1 .name

check(symbolic): shell-input:1:5: : invalid value for argument at position 0: type is %int, but %iterable was expected
```

This is convenient, but there are many cases where you **don't** want such strictness !
Let's say you are executing the following command:

```
read https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts | map_iterable $ .title
```

The type checker will complain that `$` is not an %iterable, that's pretty annoying.
You can postpone the type check of this argument at run time by prefixing it with '~'.

```
read https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts | map_iterable ~$ .title
```

Note: '~' can be added in front of any expression that is an argument in a call.


## Execute Inox Scripts from the REPL

```
run ./myscript.ix
```

⚠️ Paths always start with `./, ../ or /` , if you type `run myscript.ix` it won't work.\
⚠️ The script will be potentially granted all the permissions of the shell !

## Execute Commands

```
ex echo "hello"   # 'ex echo hello' will not work
ex #go help
```

NOTE: Almost no commands are allowed by default, edit your startup script in `.config/inox` to allow more commands (and subcommands).

## Resource Manipulation

From now on we will references files, HTTP servers and endpoints as "resources".
You can easily manipulate resources using ``read | create | update | delete | provide`` followed by the resource's name.

### Read

Read is a powerful function that allows you to get the content of files, directories & HTTP resources.

#### **Directory**

Reading the entries of a directory ``read ./dir/`` returns a list of %file-info:
```
[
    dir/
    file.txt 1kB 
]
```

#### **File**

By default the `read` function parses the content of the read file, the extension
is used to determinate the type of content.

- Reading a text file returns a string: ``read ./file.txt` -> "hello"``
- Reading a JSON file returns Inox values (objects, lists, ...) resulting from the parsing : 
    ``read ./file.json``
    ```json
    {"key": "value"}
    ```

#### **HTTP Resource**

By default the `read` function parses the content of the read resource, the Content-Type header 
is used to determinate the type of content.

Reading an JSON HTTP resource: 
``read https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1``

```json
{
  "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita....", 
  "id": 1.0, 
  "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit", 
  "userId": 1.0
}
```

Reading a HTML resource will return a `%html.node`.

#### **Raw Data**

You can disable parsing by adding the `--raw` switch **after** the resource name, a byte slice (%bytes)
will be returned instead.

### Create

Create a dir: ``create ./dir/``

Create a file: ``create ./file.txt [optional string content]``

### Update

Append to a file: ``update ./file.txt append <string>``

Patch an HTTP resource: ``update <url> <string | object>``

### Delete

Use ``delete <resource>`` for deletion. The deletion is recursive for folders.

### Find

Recursivelly find all JSON files in a directory.
```
find %./**/*.json ./
```

**You can read more about the built-in functions [here](./builtins.md)**

## Configuration

The startup script `~/.config/inox/startup.ix` (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/inox/startup.ix) is executed before the shell is started,
it returns the shell's configuration. You can modify this file if you need more permissions.

The startup script can be specificied using the `-c` flag:
```
inox shell -c startup.ix
```

### Minimal

The default startup.ix gives at lot of permissions to the shell, if you want to highly restrict
what the shell is allowed to do you should start with a minimal startup script & only add required permissions.

The smallest possible startup script returns an empty object:
```
manifest {}

return {}
```

The permissions required by the startup script are also granted to the shell: here the manifest is empty,
so the shell will not be able to read files or make network requests. 

Let's add the prompt configuration and a few permissions to make our shell usable.

```
const (
  HOME_PREFIX = /home/user/... # replace with your HOME directory
  TMP = /tmp/...
)

manifest {
  # allow the shell to read|write|delete any file in /tmp/... or in the user's HOME directory (or below).
  permissions: {
    read: { HOME_PREFIX, TMP }
    write: { HOME_PREFIX, TMP }
    delete: { HOME_PREFIX, TMP }
  }
}

return {
  builtin-commands: [#cd, #pwd, #whoami, #hostname]
  trusted-commands: [#echo, #less, #grep, #cat]

  prompt: [
    [@(whoami())  #bright-black #black]
    ["@" #bright-black #black]
    [@(hostname())  #bright-black #black]
    ":"
    [@(pwd())  #bright-blue #blue]
    "> "
  ]
}
```

### Built-in Commands

Built-in commands are provided by the shell, note that commands do not exist natively in Inox,
typing `cd ./dir/` is equivalent to `cd(./dir/)` because **cd** is a function.

There are only a few built-in commands availabe:
- cd
- pwd
- whoami
- hostname

### Trusted Commands

Trusted commands are fully trusted, when you execute a trusted command the standard input is redirected
to the spawned process.

You can try that with the following command 
```
less <file>
```

*press 'q' to leave, as you would do when using **less** in bash*

### Prompt

Here is an example of prompt configuration:
```
[
  [@(whoami())  #bright-black #black]
  ["@" #bright-black #black]
  [@(hostname())  #bright-black #black]
  ":"
  [@(pwd())  #bright-blue #blue]
  "> "
]
```

- each part is described by a value or a list; allowed values include:
  - strings & values similar to strings (paths, urls, ...) 
  - quoted expressions
- lists describe the part followed by 2 colors
  - the first color is used when the terminal's background is dark
  - the second color is used when the terminal's background is light
- quoted expressions such as @(whoami()) are evaluated each time the prompt is printed
  - they must be calls
  - only the whoami, hostname & pwd functions are allowed


## History & Completion

- Navigate the command **history** using the **Up** & **Down** arrow keys
- List completions by pressing the **Tab** key twice
