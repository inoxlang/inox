        "description": "The `hx-boost` attribute allows you to \"boost\" normal anchors and form tags to use AJAX instead.  This\nhas the [nice fallback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) that, if the user does not \nhave javascript enabled, the site will continue to work.\n\nFor anchor tags, clicking on the anchor will issue a `GET` request to the url specified in the `href` and\nwill push the url so that a history entry is created.  The target is the `<body>` tag, and the `innerHTML`\nswap strategy is used by default.  All of these can be modified by using the appropriate attributes, except\nthe `click` trigger.\n\nFor forms the request will be converted into a `GET` or `POST`, based on the method in the `method` attribute\nand will be triggered by a `submit`.  Again, the target will be the `body` of the page, and the `innerHTML`\nswap will be used. The url will _not_ be pushed, however, and no history entry will be created. (You can use the \n[hx-push-url](@/attributes/hx-push-url.md) attribute if you want the url to be pushed.)\n\nHere is an example of some boosted links:\n\n```html\n<div hx-boost=\"true\">\n  <a href=\"/page1\">Go To Page 1</a>\n  <a href=\"/page2\">Go To Page 2</a>\n</div>\n```\nThese links will issue an ajax `GET` request to the respective URLs and replace the body's inner content with it.\n\nHere is an example of a boosted form:\n\n```html\n<form hx-boost=\"true\" action=\"/example\" method=\"post\">\n    <input name=\"email\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Enter email...\">\n    <button>Submit</button>\n</form>\n```\nThis form will issue an ajax `POST` to the given URL and replace the body's inner content with it.\n\n\n## Notes\n\n* `hx-boost` is inherited and can be placed on a parent element\n* Only links that are to the same domain and that are not local anchors will be boosted\n* All requests are done via AJAX, so keep that in mind when doing things like redirects\n* To find out if the request results from a boosted anchor or form, look for [`HX-Boosted`](@/reference.md#request_headers) in the request header\n* Selectively disable boost on child elements with `hx-boost=\"false\"`",

This can be used to show spinners or progress indicators\nwhile the request is in flight.\n\nThe value of this attribute is a CSS query selector of the element or elements to apply the class to,\nor the keyword `closest`, followed by a CSS selector, which will find the closest matching parent (e.g. `closest tr`);\n\nHere is an example with a spinner adjacent to the button:\n\n```html\n<div>\n    <button hx-post=\"/example\" hx-indicator=\"#spinner\">\n        Post It!\n    </button>\n    <img  id=\"spinner\" class=\"htmx-indicator\" src=\"/img/bars.svg\"/>\n</div>\n```\n\nWhen a request is in flight, this will cause the `htmx-request` class to be added to the `#spinner`\nimage.  The image also has the `htmx-indicator` class on it, which defines an opacity transition\nthat will show the spinner:\n\n```css\n    .htmx-indicator{\n        opacity:0;\n        transition: opacity 500ms ease-in;\n    }\n    .htmx-request .htmx-indicator{\n        opacity:1\n    }\n    .htmx-request.htmx-indicator{\n        opacity:1\n    }\n```\n\nIf you would prefer a different effect for showing the spinner you could define and use your own indicator\nCSS.  Here is an example that uses `display` rather than opacity (Note that we use `my-indicator` instead of `htmx-indicator`):\n\n```css\n    .my-indicator{\n        display:none;\n    }\n    .htmx-request .my-indicator{\n        display:inline;\n    }\n    .htmx-request.my-indicator{\n        display:inline;\n    }\n```\n\nNote that the target of the `hx-indicator` selector need not be the exact element that you\nwant to show: it can be any element in the parent hierarchy of the indicator.\n\nFinally, note that the `htmx-request` class by default is added to the element causing\nthe request, so you can place an indicator inside of that element and not need to explictly\ncall it out with the `hx-indicator` attribute:\n\n```html\n<button hx-post=\"/example\">\n    Post It!\n   <img  class=\"htmx-indicator\" src=\"/img/bars.svg\"/>\n</button>\n```\n\n## Demo\n\nThis simulates what a spinner might look like in that situation:\n\n<button class=\"btn\" classes=\"toggle htmx-request:3s\">\n    Post It!\n   <img  class=\"htmx-indicator\" src=\"/img/bars.svg\"/>\n</button>\n\n## Notes\n\n* `hx-indicator` is inherited and can be placed on a parent element\n* In the absence of an explicit indicator, the `htmx-request` class will be added to the element triggering the\n  request\n* If you want to use your own CSS but still use `htmx-indicator` as class name, then you need to disable `includeIndicatorStyles`.

This allows you to respond to, for example, the many htmx-emitted events in a nice, embedded manner\nthat gives good [Locality of Behavior (LoB)](/essays/locality-of-behavior).  \n\nThe `hx-on` attribute's value is an event name, followed by a colon, followed by the event handler code:\n\n```html\n<div>\n    <button hx-get=\"/info\" hx-on=\"htmx:beforeRequest: alert('Making a request!')\">\n        Get Info!\n    </button>\n</div>\n```\n\nHere the event `hmtx:beforeRequest` is captured and shows an alert.

Please visit the\n[SSE extension page](@/extensions/server-sent-events.md) to learn about the new implementation of SSE as an extension.*\n\nThe `hx-sse` allows you to work with [Server Sent Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events)\n`EventSource`s directly from HTML.  The value of the attribute can be one or more of the following, separated by white space:\n\n* `connect:<url>` - A URL to establish an `EventSource` against\n* `swap:<eventName>` - Swap SSE message content into a DOM node on matching event names\n\n### Swap Message Content\n\nWhen an SSE connection has been established (using the `connect` keyword) the contents of SSE messages can be swapped into the DOM using the `swap` keyword.  This can be done on the element that creates the SSE connection, or any child element of it.  Multiple elements can use `swap` to listen for Server Sent Events.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```html\n<div hx-sse=\"connect:/event_stream swap:eventName\">\n  ...\n</div>\n```\n\nThis example connects to a Server Sent Event stream, and begins swapping events named `eventName` into the same element.\n\nHere is another example:\n\n```html\n<div hx-sse=\"connect:/event_stream\">\n  <div hx-sse=\"swap:eventName1\">\n    ...\n  </div>\n  <div hx-sse=\"swap:eventName2\">\n    ...\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThis example connects the Server Sent Event stream to the parent node, and directs different events to different child nodes based on the event name returned by the server.\n\n### Trigger Server Callbacks\n\nWhen a connection for server sent events has been established, child elements can listen for these events by using the special [`hx-trigger`](@/attributes/hx-trigger.md) syntax `sse:<event_name>`.  This, when combined with an `hx-get` or similar will trigger the element to make a request.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```html\n  <div hx-sse=\"connect:/event_stream\">\n    <div hx-get=\"/chatroom\" hx-trigger=\"sse:chatter\">\n      ...\n    </div>\n  </div>\n```\n\nThis example establishes an SSE connection to the `event_stream` end point which then triggers\na `GET` to the `/chatroom` url whenever the `chatter` event is seen.\n\n### Named Events\n\nThe Server Sent Event specification allows servers to optionally include an event name with every event.  **Named events** look like this:\n\n```txt\nevent: EventName\ndata: <div>Content to swap into your HTML page.</div>\n```\n\n```html\n<div hx-sse=\"connect:/server-url swap:eventName\"></div>\n```\n\n### Data Only Events\n\nAlternatively, servers can provide **data only events** that do not have a name.  In this case, Javascript (and HTMX) use the name \"message\" like this:\n\n```txt\ndata: <div>Content to swap into your HTML page.</div>\n```\n\n```html\n<div hx-sse=\"connect:/server-url swap:message\"></div>\n```\n\n### Test SSE Server\n\nHtmx includes an SSE test server with many more examples of how to use Server Sent Events.  Download the htmx source code from github and navigate to /test/servers/sse to experiment.\n\n## Notes\n\n* `hx-sse` is not inherited",

They are outlined below.\n\n#### Transition: `transition`\n\nIf you want to use the new (View Transitions)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API] API\nwhen a swap occurs, you can use the `transition:true` option for your swap.  You can also enable this feature globally by\nsetting the `htmx.config.globalViewTransitions` config setting to `true`.\n\n#### Timing: `swap` & `settle`\n\nYou can modify the amount of time that htmx will wait after receiving a response to swap the content\nby including a `swap` modifier:\n\n```html\n  <!-- this will wait 1s before doing the swap after it is received -->\n  <div hx-get=\"/example\" hx-swap=\"innerHTML swap:1s\">Get Some HTML & Append It</div>\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can modify the time between the swap and the settle logic by including a `settle`\nmodifier:\n\n```html\n  <!-- this will wait 1s before doing the swap after it is received -->\n  <div hx-get=\"/example\" hx-swap=\"innerHTML settle:1s\">Get Some HTML & Append It</div>\n```\n\nThese attributes can be used to synchronize htmx with the timing of CSS transition effects.\n\n#### Scrolling: `scroll` & `show`\n\nYou can also change the scrolling behavior of the target element by using the `scroll` and `show` modifiers, both\nof which take the values `top` and `bottom`:\n\n```html\n  <!-- this fixed-height div will scroll to the bottom of the div after content is appended -->\n  <div style=\"height:200px; overflow: scroll\" \n       hx-get=\"/example\" \n       hx-swap=\"beforeend scroll:bottom\">\n     Get Some HTML & Append It & Scroll To Bottom\n  </div>\n```\n\n```html\n  <!-- this will get some content and add it to #another-div, then ensure that the top of #another-div is visible in the \n       viewport -->\n  <div hx-get=\"/example\" \n       hx-swap=\"innerHTML show:top\"\n       hx-target=\"#another-div\">\n    Get Some Content\n  </div>\n```\n\nIf you wish to target a different element for scrolling or showing, you may place a CSS selector after the `scroll:`\nor `show:`, followed by `:top` or `:bottom`:\n\n```html\n  <!-- this will get some content and swap it into the current div, then ensure that the top of #another-div is visible in the \n       viewport -->\n  <div hx-get=\"/example\" \n       hx-swap=\"innerHTML show:#another-div:top\">\n    Get Some Content\n  </div>\n```\n\nYou may also use `window:top` and `window:bottom` to scroll to the top and bottom of the current window.\n\n\n```html\n  <!-- this will get some content and swap it into the current div, then ensure that the viewport is scrolled to the\n       very top -->\n  <div hx-get=\"/example\" \n       hx-swap=\"innerHTML show:window:top\">\n    Get Some Content\n  </div>\n```\n\n#### Focus scroll\n\nhtmx preserves focus between requests for inputs that have a defined id attribute. By default htmx prevents auto-scrolling to focused inputs between requests which can be unwanted behavior on longer requests when the user has already scrolled away. To enable focus scroll you can use `focus-scroll:true`.\n\n```html\n  <input id=\"name\" hx-get=\"/validation\" \n       hx-swap=\"outerHTML focus-scroll:true\"/>\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want the page to automatically scroll to the focused element after each request you can change the htmx global configuration value `htmx.config.defaultFocusScroll` to true. Then disable it for specific requests using `focus-scroll:false`.\n\n```html\n  <input id=\"name\" hx-get=\"/validation\" \n       hx-swap=\"outerHTML focus-scroll:false\"/>\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n* `hx-swap` is inherited and can be placed on a parent element\n* The default value of this attribute is `innerHTML`\n* Due to DOM limitations, it\u2019s not possible to use the `outerHTML` method on the `<body>` element.\n  htmx will change `outerHTML` on `<body>` to use `innerHTML`.\n* The default swap delay is 0ms\n* The default settle delay is 20ms",

        "name": "hx-sync",
        "description": "The `hx-sync` attribute allows you to synchronize AJAX requests between multiple elements.\n\nThe `hx-sync` attribute consists of a CSS selector to indicate the element to synchronize on, followed optionally\nby a colon and then by an optional syncing strategy.  The available strategies are:\n\n* `drop` - drop (ignore) this request if an existing request is in flight (the default)\n* `abort` - drop (ignore) this request if an existing request is in flight, and, if that is not the case, \n            *abort* this request if another request occurs while it is still in flight\n* `replace` - abort the current request, if any, and replace it with this request\n* `queue` - place this request in the request queue associated with the given element\n\nThe `queue` modifier can take an additional argument indicating exactly how to queue:\n\n* `queue first` - queue the first request to show up while a request is in flight\n* `queue last` - queue the last request to show up while a request is in flight\n* `queue all` - queue all requests that show up while a request is in flight\n\n## Notes\n\n* `hx-sync` is inherited and can be placed on a parent element\n\nThis example resolves a race condition between a form's submit request and an individual input's validation request. Normally, without using `hx-sync`, filling out the input and immediately submitting the form triggers two parallel requests to `/validate` and `/store`. Using `hx-sync=\"closest form:abort\"` on the input will watch for requests on the form and abort the input's request if a form request is present or starts while the input request is in flight.\n\n```html\n<form hx-post=\"/store\">\n    <input id=\"title\" name=\"title\" type=\"text\" \n        hx-post=\"/validate\" \n        hx-trigger=\"change\"\n        hx-sync=\"closest form:abort\">\n    <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n</form>\n```\n\nIf you'd rather prioritize the validation request over the submit request, you can use the `drop` strategy. This example will prioritize the validation request over the submit request so that if a validation request is in flight, the form cannot be submitted.\n\n```html\n<form hx-post=\"/store\">\n    <input id=\"title\" name=\"title\" type=\"text\" \n        hx-post=\"/validate\" \n        hx-trigger=\"change\"\n        hx-sync=\"closest form:drop\"\n    >\n    <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n</form>\n```\n\nWhen dealing with forms that contain many inputs, you can prioritize the submit request over all input validation requests using the hx-sync `replace` strategy on the form tag. This will cancel any in-flight validation requests and issue only the `hx-post=\"/store\"` request. If you'd rather abort the submit request and prioritize any existing validation requests you can use the `hx-sync=\"this:abort\"` strategy on the form tag.\n\n```html\n<form hx-post=\"/store\" hx-sync=\"this:replace\">\n    <input id=\"title\" name=\"title\" type=\"text\" hx-post=\"/validate\" hx-trigger=\"change\" />\n    <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n</form>\n```\n\nWhen implementing active search functionality the hx-trigger attribute's `delay` modifier can be used to debounce the user's input and avoid making multiple requests while the user types. However, once a request is made, if the user begins typing again a new request will begin even if the previous one has not finished processing. This example will cancel any in-flight requests and use only the last request. In cases where the search input is contained within the target, then using `hx-sync` like this also helps reduce the chances that the input will be replaced while the user is still typing.\n\n```html\n<input type=\"search\" \n    hx-get=\"/search\" \n    hx-trigger=\"keyup changed delay:500ms, search\" \n    hx-target=\"#search-results\"\n    hx-sync=\"this:replace\">\n```",

        "description": "The `hx-trigger` attribute allows you to specify what triggers an AJAX request.  A trigger\nvalue can be one of the following:\n\n* An event name (e.g. \"click\" or \"my-custom-event\") followed by an event filter and a set of event modifiers\n* A polling definition of the form `every <timing declaration>`\n* A comma-separated list of such events\n\n### Standard Events\n\nA standard event, such as `click` can be specified as the trigger like so:\n\n```html\n<div hx-get=\"/clicked\" hx-trigger=\"click\">Click Me</div>\n```\n\n#### Standard Event Filters\n\nEvents can be filtered by enclosing a boolean javascript expression in square brackets after the event name.  If\nthis expression evaluates to `true` the event will be triggered, otherwise it will be ignored.\n\n```html\n<div hx-get=\"/clicked\" hx-trigger=\"click[ctrlKey]\">Control Click Me</div>\n```\n\nThis event will trigger if a click event is triggered with the `event.ctrlKey` property set to true.\n\nConditions can also refer to global functions or state\n\n```html\n<div hx-get=\"/clicked\" hx-trigger=\"click[checkGlobalState()]\">Control Click Me</div>\n```\n\nAnd can also be combined using the standard javascript syntax\n\n```html\n<div hx-get=\"/clicked\" hx-trigger=\"click[ctrlKey&&shiftKey]\">Control-Shift Click Me</div>\n```\n\nNote that all symbols used in the expression will be resolved first against the triggering event, and then next\nagainst the global namespace, so `myEvent[foo]` will first look for a property named `foo` on the event, then look\nfor a global symbol with the name `foo`\n\n#### Standard Event Modifiers\n\nStandard events can also have modifiers that change how they behave.  The modifiers are:\n\n* `once` - the event will only trigger once (e.g. the first click)\n* `changed` - the event will only change if the value of the element has changed. Please pay attention `change` is the name of the event and `changed` is the name of the modifier.\n* `delay:<timing declaration>` - a delay will occur before an event triggers a request.  If the event\nis seen again it will reset the delay.\n* `throttle:<timing declaration>` - a throttle will occur before an event triggers a request.  If the event\nis seen again before the delay completes it is ignored, the element will trigger at the end of the delay.\n* `from:<Extended CSS selector>` - allows the event that triggers a request to come from another element in the document (e.g. listening to a key event on the body, to support hot keys)\n  * The extended CSS selector here allows for the following non-standard CSS values:\n    * `document` - listen for events on the document\n    * `window` - listen for events on the window\n    * `closest <CSS selector>` - finds the closest parent matching the given css selector\n    * `find <CSS selector>` - finds the closest child matching the given css selector\n* `target:<CSS selector>` - allows you to filter via a CSS selector on the target of the event.  This can be useful when you want to listen for\ntriggers from elements that might not be in the DOM at the point of initialization, by, for example, listening on the body,\nbut with a target filter for a child element\n* `consume` - if this option is included the event will not trigger any other htmx requests on parents (or on elements\n  listening on parents)\n* `queue:<queue option>` - determines how events are queued if an event occurs while a request for another event is in flight.  Options are:\n  * `first` - queue the first event\n  * `last` - queue the last event (default)\n  * `all` - queue all events (issue a request for each event)\n  * `none` - do not queue new events\n\nHere is an example of a search box that searches on `keyup`, but only if the search value has changed\nand the user hasn't typed anything new for 1 second:\n\n```html\n<input name=\"q\"\n       hx-get=\"/search\" hx-trigger=\"keyup changed delay:1s\"\n       hx-target=\"#search-results\"/>\n```\n\nThe response from the `/search` url will be appended to the `div` with the id `search-results`.\n\n### Non-standard Events\n\nThere are some additional non-standard events that htmx supports:\n\n* `load` - triggered on load (useful for lazy-loading something)\n* `revealed` - triggered when an element is scrolled into the viewport (also useful for lazy-loading). If you are using `overflow` in css like `overflow-y: scroll` you should use `intersect once` instead of `revealed`.\n* `intersect` - fires once when an element first intersects the viewport.  This supports two additional options:\n    * `root:<selector>` - a CSS selector of the root element for intersection\n    * `threshold:<float>` - a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0, indicating what amount of intersection to fire the event on\n\n### Triggering via the `HX-Trigger` header\n\nIf you're trying to fire an event from <code>HX-Trigger</code> response  header, you will likely want to\nuse the `from:body` modifier.  E.g. if you send a header like this <code>HX-Trigger: my-custom-event</code>\nwith a response, an element would likely need to look like this:\n\n```html\n  <div hx-get=\"/example\" hx-trigger=\"my-custom-event from:body\">\n    Triggered by HX-Trigger header...\n  </div>\n```\n\nin order to fire.\n\nThis is because the header will likely trigger the event in a different DOM hierarchy than the element that you\nwish to be triggered.  For a similar reason, you will often listen for hot keys from the body.\n\n### Polling\n\nBy using the syntax `every <timing declaration>` you can have an element poll periodically:\n\n```html\n<div hx-get=\"/latest_updates\" hx-trigger=\"every 1s\">\n  Nothing Yet!\n</div>\n```\n\nThis example will issue a `GET` to the `/latest_updates` URL every second and swap the results into\nthe innerHTML of this div.\n\nIf you want to add a filter to polling, it should be added *after* the poll declaration:\n\n```html\n<div hx-get=\"/latest_updates\" hx-trigger=\"every 1s [someConditional]\">\n  Nothing Yet!\n</div>\n```\n\n### Multiple Triggers\n\nMultiple triggers can be provided, seprarated by commas.  Each trigger gets its own options.\n```html\n  <div hx-get=\"/news\" hx-trigger=\"load, click delay:1s\"></div>\n```\nThis example will load `/news` immediate on the page load, and then again with a delay of one second after each click.\n\n### Via JavaScript\n\nThe AJAX request can be triggered via JavaScript [`htmx.trigger()`](@/api.md#trigger), too.\n\n## Notes\n\n* `hx-trigger` is not inherited\n* `hx-trigger` can be used without an AJAX request, in which case it will only fire the `htmx:trigger` event",

Please visit the \n[WebSockets extension page](@/extensions/web-sockets.md) to learn about the new implementation of Web Sockets as an extension.*\n\nThe `hx-ws` allows you to work with [Web Sockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications)\ndirectly from HTML.  The value of the attribute can be one or more of the following, separated by commas:\n\n* `connect:<url>` or `connect:<prefix>:<url>` - A URL to establish an `WebSocket` connection against.\n* Prefixes `ws` or `wss` can optionally be specified. If not specified, HTMX defaults to add the location's scheme-type, host and port to have browsers send cookies via websockets.\n* `send` - Sends a message to the nearest websocket based on the trigger value for the element (either the natural event\nor the event specified by [`hx-trigger`])\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```html\n  <div hx-ws=\"connect:/chatroom\">\n    <div id=\"chat_room\">\n      ...\n    </div>\n    <form hx-ws=\"send\">\n        <input name=\"chat_message\">\n    </form>\n  </div>\n```\n\nThis example establishes a WebSocket to the `chatroom` end point.  Content that is sent down from the websocket will\nbe parsed as HTML and swapped in by the `id` property, using the same logic as [Out of Band Swaps](@/attributes/hx-swap-oob.md).\n\nThe form uses the `send` syntax to indicate that when it is submitted, the form values should be serialized as JSON\nand send to the nearest enclosing `WebSocket`.\n\nThe serialized values will include a field, `HEADERS`, that includes the headers normally submitted with an htmx\nrequest.\n\nAfter an unexpected connection loss due to `Abnormal Closure`, `Service Restart` or `Try Again Later`,\nreconnecting is tried until successful.\nThe default reconnection interval is implemented with the full-jitter exponential-backoff algorithm.\nOwn implementations can be provided by setting `htmx.config.wsReconnectDelay` to a function with\n`retryCount` as its only parameter.\n\n\n### Test Web Sockets Server\n\nHtmx includes a WebSockets test server with many more examples of how to use Server Sent Events.  Download the htmx source code from github and navigate to /test/servers/ws to experiment.\n\n## Notes\n\n* `hx-ws` is not inherited",
