response-headers:
  HX-Location:
    short-explanation: client-side redirect (no full page reload).
    documentation: >
      https://htmx.org/headers/hx-location. This response header can be used to trigger a client side redirection without 
      reloading the whole page. Instead of changing the page’s location it will act like following a hx-boost link, creating 
      a new history entry, issuing an ajax request to the value of the header and pushing the path into history.
  HX-Redirect: 
    short-explanation: client-side redirect (other page).
  HX-Refresh:
    short-explanation: refreshes the page if "true"
    documentation: 'If set to “true” the client-side will do a full refresh of the page.'
  HX-Push-Url: 
    short-explanation: pushes a new url into the history
    documentation: >
      https://htmx.org/headers/hx-push-url. The HX-Push-Url header allows you to push a URL into the browser location history. 
      This creates a new history entry, allowing navigation with the browser’s back and forward buttons. 
  HX-Replace-Url:
    short-explanation: pushes a new url into the history
    documentation: >
      https://htmx.org/headers/hx-replace-url. The HX-Replace-Url header allows you to replace the current URL in the
      browser location history. This does not create a new history entry; in effect, it removes the previous current URL 
      from the browser’s history.  This is similar to the hx-replace-url attribute.
  HX-Reswap: 
    documentation: Allows you to specify how the response will be swapped. See hx-swap (https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap) for possible values.
  HX-Retarget:
    documentation: A CSS selector that updates the target of the content update to a different element on the page
  HX-Reselect:
    documentation: >
       A CSS selector that allows you to choose which part of the response is used to be swapped in. 
       Overrides an existing hx-select on the triggering element.
  HX-Trigger: 
    short-explanation: triggers client-side events
    documentation: >
      https://htmx.org/headers/hx-trigger. This response header can be used to trigger client side actions on the target element 
      within a response to htmx. You can trigger a single event or as many uniquely named events as you would like. Example: `HX-Trigger: myEvent`.
      Available variations are `HX-Trigger-After-Settle` and `HX-Trigger-After-Swap`.
  HX-Trigger-After-Settle:
    short-explanation: https://htmx.org/headers/hx-trigger

  HX-Trigger-After-Swap: 
    short-explanation: https://htmx.org/headers/hx-trigger
